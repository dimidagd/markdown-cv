## Summary

I’m a visual AI engineer passionate about empowering developers through better data tools and model transparency. I specialize in multimodal ML pipelines, model deployment, and visual dataset curation. I thrive in collaborative environments where engineering meets research, and I'm driven by impact, clarity, and community.


## Professional Experience

`2024 – Present`  
__Senior AI/MLOps Engineer__, Danish Defence, Copenhagen  

- Led a data-centric AI strategy that developed an enterprise-grade ML product capable of processing world-scale data, deployed in high-stakes, real-world environments. 
- Integrated and extended tooling for unstructured visual dataset debugging, curation, and quality control—contributed upstream to support multimodal extensions.  
- Built reusable tooling to explore and annotate multimodal datasets, improving annotation efficiency and model performance.  
- Scaled MLOps practices across teams—automated deployment, monitoring, and versioning of models across projects.  
- Fostered internal knowledge-sharing by hosting weekly ML reading groups and cross-functional workshops.  
- Architected self-supervised and active learning workflows, minimizing human labeling efforts and improving performance metrics on edge cases.


`2020 – 2024`  
__AI Engineer__, ShippingLab, Copenhagen  

- Delivered real-time visual perception systems for autonomous maritime navigation, optimized for challenging and dynamic environments.
- Led R&D on cutting-edge perception models, rapidly prototyping and iterating on both state-of-the-art and novel architectures to meet mission-specific requirements.
- Owned the end-to-end lifecycle of perception ML models—driving data strategy, model development, optimization, validation, and deployment into the vessel platform.
- Integrated simulation and real-world data pipelines to accelerate model evaluation and validation cycles, consistently delivering improved metrics on a weekly cadence.
- Architected and deployed a cross-modal autolabeling pipeline (camera, LiDAR, radar), exploiting spatial-temporal alignment to generate high-fidelity annotations and significantly reducing manual labeling overhead.
- Designed and scaled a robust MLOps stack, including a data lake, warehouse, model experiment tracking, validation pipelines, integration testing, and CI/CD.
- Mentored junior researchers & S/W engineers in dataset analysis, model debugging, and reproducibility, fostering a culture of technical excellence and rapid learning.


`2022`  
__Visiting AI Research Engineer__, SeaAI, Vienna  

- Built large-scale ML pipelines for maritime visual datasets.  
- Prototyped a transition from 2D object detection to 3D spatial reasoning using depth-aware models.

`2020 – 2024`  
__PhD Research, Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen  

- Multimodal object tracking frameworks.
- Sensor fusion for reliable perception and scene understanding.
- Data fusion for GNSS denied navigation. 
- Led large-scale data collection efforts; implemented pipelines for annotation, preprocessing, and synthetic data generation.  
- International conferences publications and presentations.  
- Leading junior researchers and s/w engineers, converting research prototypes into products.
